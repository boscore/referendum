# `auditor.bos` - BOS Auditor Elections Contract

This contract will be in charge of auditor registration and voting for BOS auditors.

When an auditor registers, they need to provide their bio by calling the `updatebio` action.

If an elected auditor resigns via the `withdrawcand` during a period a new candidate will be chosen to fill the gap on the auditor board from the votes ranking in the candidates at that moment.

## Quickstart

### Nominate Candidante

> Must `eosio::transfer` BOS tokens at a minimum of `lockupasset` before submitting `nominatecand` action
> Once candidate is nominated, BOS users can now vote for that candidate to become a BOS auditor.

```
$ bosc transfer <CANDIDATE> auditor.bos "100.0000 BOS" -m "stake for auditor.bos"
$ bosc tx create auditor.bos nominatecand '{"cand": "<CANDIDATE>"}' -p <CANDIDATE>@active
```

### Vote for Auditor Candidate

```
$ bosc tx create auditor.bos vote '{"voter":"<VOTER>","newvotes":["<CANDIDATE_1>", "<CANDIDATE_2>","<CANDIDATE_3>"]}' -p deniscarrier
```

### Withdraw Candidate & Unstake

$ bosc tx create auditor.bos newtenure '{"candidates": ["<CANDIDATE 1>", "<CANDIDATE 2>"], "message":"newtenure for auditor.bos"}' -p auditor.bos@active
```
