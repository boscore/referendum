     *
     * This action asserts:
     *
     * - the message has the permission of the contract account.
     * - the supplied asset symbol matches the current lockup symbol if it has been previously set or that there have been no 	.
     *
     * The parameters are:
     *
     * - lockupasset(uint8_t) : defines the asset and amount required for a user to register as a candidate. This is the amount that will be locked up until the user calls `withdrawcand` in order to get the asset returned to them. If there are currently already registered candidates in the contract this cannot be changed to a different asset type because of introduced complexity of handling the staked amounts.
     * - maxvotes(asset) : Defines the maximum number of candidates a user can vote for at any given time.
     * - numelected(uint16_t) : The number of candidates to elect for auditors. This is used for the payment amount to auditors for median amount.
     * - authaccount(name) : The managing account that controls the BOS auditor permission.
     * - auth_threshold_auditors (uint8) : The number of auditors required to approve an action in the low permission category ( ordinary action such as a worker proposal).
