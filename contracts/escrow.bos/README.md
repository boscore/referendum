# BOS escrow

An escrow contract designed for paying worker proposals.  The intention is that the authority for this account would be nulled.

## Quickstart

### Init Escrow

> Only `bet.bos@active` can `init` an escrow.
> This will initialize the escrow between the `sender` & `receiver`.

```bash
$ bosc tx create escrow.bos init '{"sender":"bet.bos","receiver":"<RECEIVER>","approver":"eosio","escrow_name":"<NAME>","expires_at":"2019-09-15T00:00:00","memo":"BOS escrow"}' -p bet.bos
```

### Fund/Initialize Escrow

> BOS funds must be `transfer` into the `escrow.bos` account before starting another escrow

```bash
$ bosc transfer bet.bos escrow.bos "100.0000 BOS" -m "<ESCROW NAME>" -p bet.bos
```

### Approve Escrow

> Only `bet.bos@active` or `eosio@active` are allowed to approve.
> if approver is bet.bos, no change, allow proposer to claim 100% of the fund
> if approver is BPs, only keep 90% fund for proposer to claim, and BET.BOS will manually execute transfer ACTION in escrow.bos to send fund to each BPs and each auditors

```bash
$ bosc tx create escrow.bos approve '{"escrow_name":"<NAME>","approver":"eosio"}' -p eosio
```


### Review Escrow

Allows the {{ sender }}, {{ approver }} or {{ receiver }} to perform an on-chain notification which is used to signal a review of the {{ escrow_name }}.

```bash
$ bosc tx create escrow.bos review '{"escrow_name":"<NAME>","user":"<USER>","reviewer":"<REVIEWER>","memo": "review escrow"}' -p <USER>
```

### Claim Escrow

> Executing `claim` will complete the escrow process and transfer the BOS tokens to the receiver.
> Anyone can execute the `claim` action.

```bash
$ bosc tx create escrow.bos claim '{"escrow_name":"<NAME>"}' -p <ACCOUNT>
```

### Proposing `approve` MSIG

1. Create an `approve.json` transaction file which is signed by `eosio@active`

```bash
$ bosc tx create escrow.bos approve '{"escrow_name": "<NAME>", "approver":"eosio"}' -p eosio --skip-sign --expiration 36000 --write-transaction approve.json
```

2. Propose MSIG

```bash
$ bosc multisig propose <PROPOSER> <PROPOSAL NAME> approve.json --request-producers
```

3. Exec MSIG

```bash
$ bosc multisig exec <PROPOSER> <PROSOAL NAME> <EXECUTER>
```

## Caveats

- The sender of an escrow will temporarily be whitelisted to BOS executives. In the future anyone may be a sender
- The sender may only have one unfilled escrow at any given time, however they may have many filled escrows
- To fill an escrow the sender must transfer the `BOS` tokens to this contract. An unfilled escrow will be filled
- The receiver is considered as always approving the escrow. An approval must come from either the sender or the approver
- The sender may only cancel an escrow that has not been filled
- The sender may only refund an escrow that has passed it's expiry
- Unapprove only removes an existing approval, if the action is made before the receiver uses the claim action
- A sender may extend the expiry but not shorten it
- The approver may change extend or shorten the expiry
- The approver may close an escrow. This is essentially the same as refunding it, however without waiting for the expiry to lapse
- The approver may Lock and Unlock an escrow. This prevents ALL actions except unlock and actions made by the approver.
